# Why SQL? 
## Talk demo files

This repository contains my *Why SQL?* talk demo files. The files contains some samples I show during the talk using Spark SQL and Scala.

The data used for this demo can be obtained under the link: https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/sales-products-sample-data/ and need to be put into the `data/` folder.
